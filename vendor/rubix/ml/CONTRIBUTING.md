# Contributing Guidelines
Thank you for considering a code contribution to Rubix ML. We strongly believe that our contributors play the most important role in bringing powerful machine learning tools to the PHP language. Please read over the following guidelines so that we can continue to provide high quality machine learning tools that our users love.

### Pull Request Checklist
Here are a few things to check off before sending in a pull request ...

- Your changes pass [static analysis](#static-analysis)
- All [unit tests](#unit-testing) pass
- Your changes are consistent with our [coding style](#coding-style)
- Does your change require updates to the documentation?
- Does an entry to the CHANGELOG need to be added?

> New to pull requests? Github has a great [howto](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) to get you started.

## Static Analysis
Static code analysis is an integral part of our overall testing and quality assurance strategy. Static analysis allows us to catch bugs before they make it into the codebase. Therefore, it is important that your updates pass static analysis at the level set by the project lead.

To run static analysis:
```sh
$ composer analyze
```
  
## Unit Testing
Almost always, *new* code will require an accompanying unit test - whether it be a new feature or a bug fix. What to test depends on the type of change you are making. See the individual unit testing guidelines below.

To run the unit tests:
```sh
$ composer test
```

### Learner Testing
Rubix ML uses a unique end-to-end testing schema for all learners that involves generating a controlled training and testing set, training the learner, and then validating its predictions using an industry-standard scoring metric. The reason for this type of test is to be able to confirm that the learner offers the ability to generalize its training to new data. Since not all learners are the same, choose a generator (dataset) and minimum validation score that is appropriate for a real world use case.

> **Note:** Be sure to seed the random number generator with a known constant in your tests.

### Bugfix Testing
Typically bugs indicate an area of the code that has not been properly tested yet. When submitting a bug fix, please include a passing test that would have reproduced the bug prior to your changes.

## Coding Style
Rubix ML follows the PSR-2 coding style with additional rules to keep the codebase tidy and reduce cognitive load.

To run the style checker:
```sh
$ composer check
```

To run the style fixer:
```sh
$ composer fix
```

### Class Organization
For any new class, include a class header that contains a title, a short description of what the class does, any references, and the author and package name. If you are making changes to an existing class, you may add your name to the author list under the last entry if you want. Organization should flow in the following order from the top of the class to the bottom - namespace declaration, class imports, function imports, constant imports, class definition, traits, class constants, properties, static methods, constructor, regular methods, methods that implement a standard PHP interface, and finally, any other magic methods.

### Mutability
Objects implemented in Rubix ML have a mutability policy of *generally* immutable which means properties are protected and state cannot be modified without creating a new object. Certain objects such as Learners have model parameters that are mutated during training. In such cases, mutability must be controlled through public interfaces. In general, any stateful object that requires mutation must only be updated through a well-defined public method. In some special cases, such as for performance reasons, object properties may be allowed to be mutated directly.

### Anonymous Classes and Functions
Due to a limitation in PHP that requires objects and functions to be named in order to be unserialized and since the library relies on serialization for persistence, we do not use anonymous classes or functions in our codebase. Instead, create a new named class or function.

## Benchmarks
Performance can be critical for some machine learning projects. Not only that, waiting sucks in general. To ensure that our users have the best user experience, we benchmark every learner and use the information as a baseline to make optimizations. When contributing a new learner to Rubix ML, include a benchmark.

To run the benchmarking suite:
```sh
$ composer benchmark
```

## Anti Plagiarism Policy
Our community takes a strong stance against plagiarism, or the copying of another author's code without attribution. Since the spirit of open source is to make code freely available, it is up to the community to enforce policies that deter plagiarism. As such, we do not allow contributions from those who violate this policy.
