# Gaussian MLE
The Gaussian Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE) is able to spot outliers by computing a probability density function (PDF) over the features assuming they are independently and normally (Gaussian) distributed. Assigning low probability density to a sample translates to a high anomaly score.

**Interfaces:** [Estimator](../estimator.md), [Learner](../learner.md), [Online](../online.md), [Ranking](../ranking.md), [Persistable](../persistable.md)

**Data Type Compatibility:** Continuous

## Parameters
| # | Param | Default | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | threshold | 5.0 | float | The minimum log likelihood to be flagged as an anomaly. |
| 2 | contamination | 0.1 | float | The percentage of outliers that are assumed to be present in the training set. |

## Additional Methods
Return the column means computed from the training set:
```php
public means() : array
```

Return the column variances computed from the training set:
```php
public variances() : array
```

## Example
```php
use Rubix\ML\AnomalyDetectors\GaussianMLE;

$estimator = new GaussianMLE(6.0, 0.1);
```
