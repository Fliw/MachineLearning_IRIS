# Inference
Most of a model's lifetime will be spent performing inference for analysis or production. Inference is the process of making predictions using an estimator. You can think of an estimator as *inferring* the outcome of a sample given the input features and the estimator's hidden state created during training.

## Making Predictions
All estimators implement the [Estimator](estimator.md) interface which provides the `predict()` method. The `predict()` method takes a dataset of samples as its only argument and returns their predictions in order. There are 4 base estimator types in Rubix ML and each type makes a prediction specific to its type.

| Estimator Type | Prediction | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| Classifier | A categorical class label | `cat`, `dog`, `ship` |
| Regressor | A continuous value | `490,000` or `1.67592` |
| Clusterer | A discrete cluster number | `0`, `1`, `2`, etc. |
| Anomaly Detector | `1` for an anomaly, `0` otherwise | `0` or `1` |

**Example**

```php
$predictions = $estimator->predict($dataset);

var_dump($predictions);
```

```sh
array(3) {
  [0]=>
  string(3) "cat"
  [1]=>
  string(3) "dog"
  [2]=>
  string(4) "frog"
}
```

## Single Predictions
To make a prediction on a single sample, pass the raw sample to the `predictSample()` method available on the [Learner](learner.md) interface.

```php
$prediction = $estimator->predictSample([0.25, 3, 'furry']);

var_dump($prediction);
```

```sh
string(3) "cat"
```

## Estimation of Probabilities
Sometimes, you may want to know how *certain* the model is about a particular outcome. Classifiers and clusterers that implement the [Probabilistic](https://docs.rubixml.com/en/latest/probabilistic.html) interface have a `proba()` method that outputs the joint probability estimates for each class or cluster number as shown in the example below.

**Example**

```php
$probabilities = $estimator->proba($dataset);  

var_dump($probabilities);
```

```sh
array(2) {
	[0] => array(2) {
		['monster'] => 0.975,
		['not monster'] => 0.025,
	}
	[1] => array(2) {
		['monster'] => 0.2,
		['not monster'] => 0.8,
	}
}
```

## Ranking Samples
Certain anomaly detectors that implement the [Ranking](https://docs.rubixml.com/en/latest/ranking.html) interface can produce an anomaly score from the samples in a dataset. Anomaly scores are useful for attaining the degree of anomalousness for a sample. Higher anomaly scores equate to greater abnormality. Often, samples are sorted by their anomaly score and the top *k* samples are further analyzed by another system or human expert.

**Example**

```php
$scores = $estimator->rank($dataset);

var_dump($scores);
```

```sh
array(3) {
  [0]=> float(0.35033859096744)
  [1]=> float(0.40992076925443)
  [2]=> float(1.68163357834096)
}
```
